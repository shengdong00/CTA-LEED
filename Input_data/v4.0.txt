To support high-performance, cost-effective project outcomes through an early analysis of the
interrelationships among systems.
Beginning in pre-design and continuing throughout the design phases, identify and use opportunities to
achieve synergies across disciplines and building systems. Use the analyses described below to inform
the owner’s project requirements (OPR), basis of design (BOD), design documents, and construction
documents.
Energy-Related Systems
Discovery: Perform a preliminary “simple box” energy modeling analysis before the completion of
schematic design that explores how to reduce energy loads in the building and accomplish related
sustainability goals by questioning default assumptions. Assess at least two potential strategies
associated with the following:
• Site conditions. Assess shading, exterior lighting, hardscape, landscaping, and adjacent site
conditions.
• Massing and orientation. Assess massing and orientation affect HVAC sizing, energy
consumption, lighting, and renewable energy opportunities.
• Basic envelope attributes. Assess insulation values, window-to-wall ratios, glazing
characteristics, shading, and window operability.
• Lighting levels. Assess interior surface reflectance values and lighting levels in occupied
spaces.
• Thermal comfort ranges. Assess thermal comfort range options.
• Plug and process load needs. Assess reducing plug and process loads through
programmatic solutions (e.g., equipment and purchasing policies, layout options).
• Programmatic and operational parameters. Assess multifunctioning spaces, operating
schedules, space allotment per person, teleworking, reduction of building area, and
anticipated operations and maintenance.
Implementation: Document how the above analysis informed design and building form decisions in
the project’s OPR and BOD and the eventual design of the project, including the following, as
applicable:
• Building and site program;
• Building form and geometry;
• Building envelope and façade treatments on different orientations;
• Elimination and/or significant downsizing of building systems (e.g., HVAC, lighting, controls, Exterior materials, interior finishes, and functional program elements); and
• Other systems.
AND
Water-Related Systems
Discovery: Perform a preliminary water budget analysis before the completion of schematic design that explores how to reduce potable water loads in the building and accomplish related sustainability goals. Assess and estimate the project’s potential nonpotable water supply sources and water demand volumes, including the following:
• Indoor water demand. Assess flow and flush fixture design case demand volumes, calculated in accordance with WE Prerequisite Indoor Water Use Reduction.
• Outdoor water demand. Assess landscape irrigation design case demand volume calculated in accordance with WE Credit Outdoor Water-Use Reduction.
• Process water demand. Assess kitchen, laundry, cooling tower, and other equipment demand volumes, as applicable.
• Supply sources. Assess all potential nonpotable water supply source volumes, such as on-site rainwater and graywater, municipally supplied nonpotable water, and HVAC equipment condensate.
Implementation: Document how the above analysis informed building and site design decisions in the project’s OPR and BOD. Demonstrate how at least one on-site nonpotable water supply source was analyzed to reduce the burden on municipal supply or wastewater treatment systems by contributing to at least two of the water demand components listed above. Demonstrate how the analysis informed the design of the project, including the following, as applicable:
• plumbing systems;
• sewage conveyance and/or on-site treatment systems;
• rainwater quantity and quality management systems;
• landscaping, irrigation, and site elements;
• roofing systems and/or building form and geometry; and
• other systems.

LT-6
To promote bicycling and transportation efficiency and reduce vehicle distance traveled. To improve public health by encouraging utilitarian and recreational physical activity.
Bicycle Network
Design or locate the project such that a functional entry or bicycle storage is within a 200-yard (180-meter) walking distance or bicycling distance from a bicycle network that connects to at least one of the following:
• at least 10 diverse uses (see Appendix 1);

• a bus rapid transit stop, light or heavy rail station, commuter rail station, or ferry terminal.
All destinations must be within a 3-mile (4800-meter) bicycling distance of the project boundary.
Planned bicycle trails or lanes may be counted if they are fully funded by the date of the certificate of occupancy and are scheduled for completion within one year of that date.
Bicycle Storage and Shower Rooms
Case 1. Commercial or Institutional Projects
Provide short-term bicycle storage for at least 2.5% of all peak visitors, but no fewer than four storage spaces per building.
Provide long-term bicycle storage for at least 5% of all regular building occupants, but no fewer than four storage spaces per building in addition to the short-term bicycle storage spaces.

Provide long-term bicycle storage for at least 30% of all regular building occupants, but no less than one storage space per residential unit.
Case 3. Mixed-Use Projects
Meet the Case 1 and Case 2 storage requirements for the nonresidential and residential portions of the project, respectively.
For All Projects
Short-term bicycle storage must be within 100 feet (30 meters) walking distance of any main entrance. Long-term bicycle storage must be within 100 feet (30 meters) walking distance of any functional entry.
Bicycle storage capacity may not be double-counted: storage that is fully allocated to the occupants of nonproject facilities cannot also serve project occupants.
Core & Shell projects should refer to Appendix 2, Default Occupancy Counts, for occupancy count requirements and guidance.

LT-7
To minimize the environmental harms associated with parking facilities, including automobile dependence, land consumption, and rainwater runoff.
Do not exceed the minimum local code requirements for parking capacity.
Provide parking capacity that is a percentage reduction below the base ratios recommended by the Parking Consultants Council, as shown in the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ Transportation Planning Handbook, 3rd edition, Tables 18-2 through 18-4.
Case 1. Baseline Location
Projects that have not earned points under LT Credit Surrounding Density and Diverse Uses or LT Credit Access to Quality Transit must achieve a 20% reduction from the base ratios.
Case 2. Dense and/or Transit-Served Location
Projects earning 1 or more points under either LT Credit Surrounding Density and Diverse Uses or LT Credit Access to Quality Transit must achieve a 40% reduction from the base ratios.
For All Projects
The credit calculations must include all existing and new off-street parking spaces that are leased or owned by the project, including parking that is outside the project boundary but is used by the project. On-street parking in public rights-of-way is excluded from these calculations.
For projects that use pooled parking, calculate compliance using the project’s share of the pooled parking.
Provide preferred parking for carpools for 5% of the total parking spaces after reductions are made from the base ratios. Preferred parking is not required if no off-street parking is provided.
Mixed-use projects should determine the percentage reduction by first aggregating the parking amount of each use (as specified by the base ratios) and then determining the percentage reduction from the aggregated parking amount.
Do not count parking spaces for fleet and inventory vehicles unless these vehicles are regularly used by employees for commuting as well as business purposes.

LT-8
To reduce pollution by promoting alternatives to conventionally fueled automobiles.
Designate 5% of all parking spaces used by the project as preferred parking for green vehicles. Clearly identify and enforce for sole use by green vehicles. Distribute preferred parking spaces proportionally among various parking sections (e.g. between short-term and long-term spaces).
Green vehicles must achieve a minimum green score of 45 on the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) annual vehicle rating guide (or local equivalent for projects outside the U.S.).
A discounted parking rate of at least 20% for green vehicles is an acceptable substitute for preferred parking spaces. The discounted rate must be publicly posted at the entrance of the parking area and permanently available to every qualifying vehicle.
In addition to preferred parking for green vehicles, meet one of the following two options for alternative-fuel fueling stations:
Option 1. Electric Vehicle Charging
Install electrical vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) in 2% of all parking spaces used by the project. Clearly identify and reserve these spaces for the sole use by plug-in electric vehicles. EVSE parking spaces must be provided in addition to preferred parking spaces for green vehicles.
The EVSE must:
• Provide a Level 2 charging capacity (208 – 240 volts) or greater.
• Comply with the relevant regional or local standard for electrical connectors, such as SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J1772, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler or IEC 62196 of the International Electrotechnical Commission for projects outside the U.S.
• Be networked or internet addressable and be capable of participating in a demand-response program or time-of-use pricing to encourage off-peak charging.
OR
Option 2. Liquid, gas, or battery facilities
Install liquid or gas alternative fuel fueling facilities or a battery switchingstation capable of refueling a number of vehicles per day equal to at least 2% of all parking spaces.

• Vegetation. Primary vegetation types, greenfield area, significant tree mapping, threatened or endangered species, unique habitat, invasive plant species.
• Soils. Natural Resources Conservation Service soils delineation, U.S. Department of Agriculture prime farmland, healthy soils, previous development, disturbed soils (local equivalent standards may be used for projects outside the U.S.).
• Human use. Views, adjacent transportation infrastructure, adjacent properties, construction materials with existing recycle or reuse potential.
• Human health effects. Proximity of vulnerable populations, adjacent physical activity opportunities, proximity to major sources of air pollution.
The survey or assessment should demonstrate the relationships between the site features and topics listed above and how these features influenced the project design; give the reasons for not addressing any of those topics.

SS-2.1
To conserve existing natural areas and restore damaged areas to provide habitat and promote biodiversity.
Preserve and protect from all development and construction activity 40% of the greenfield area on the site (if such areas exist).
AND
Option 1. On-Site Restoration (2 points except Healthcare, 1 point Healthcare)
Using native or adapted vegetation, restore 30% (including the building footprint) of all portions of the site identified as previously disturbed. Projects that achieve a density of 1.5 floor-area ratio may include vegetated roof surfaces in this calculation if the plants are native or adapted, provide habitat, and promote biodiversity.
Restore all disturbed or compacted soils that will be revegetated within the project’s development footprint to meet the following requirements2:
• Soils (imported and in situ) must be reused for functions comparable to their original function.
• Imported topsoils or soil blends designed to serve as topsoil may not include the following:
o soils defined regionally by the Natural Resources Conservation Service web soil survey (or local equivalent for projects outside the U.S.) as prime farmland, unique farmland, or farmland of statewide or local importance; or
o soils from other greenfield sites, unless those soils are a byproduct of a construction process.
• Restored soil must meet the criteria of reference soils in categories 1–3 and meet the criteria of either category 4 or 5:
1. organic matter;
2. compaction;
3. infiltration rates;
4. soil biological function; and
5. soil chemical characteristics.
Project teams may exclude vegetated landscape areas that are constructed to accommodate rainwater infiltration from the vegetation and soils requirements, provided all such rainwater infiltration areas are treated consistently with SS Credit Rainwater Management.
Schools only:
Dedicated athletic fields that are solely for athletic uses are exempted from the soil restoration criteria. These areas may not count toward the minimum required area.
OR
Option 2. Financial Support (1 point)
Provide financial support equivalent to at least $0.40 per square foot (US$4 per square meter) for the total site area (including the building footprint).
Financial support must be provided to a nationally or locally recognized land trust or conservation organization within the same EPA Level III ecoregion or the project’s state (or within 100 miles of the project [160 kilometers] for projects outside the U.S.). For U.S. projects, the land trust must be accredited by the Land Trust Alliance.

SS-3
To create exterior open space that encourages interaction with the environment, social interaction, passive recreation, and physical activities.
Provide outdoor space greater than or equal to 30% of the total site area (including building footprint). A minimum of 25% of that outdoor space must be vegetated (turf grass does not count as vegetation) or have overhead vegetated canopy.
The outdoor space must be physically accessible and be one or more of the following:
• a pedestrian-oriented paving or turf area with physical site elements that accommodate outdoor social activities;
• a recreation-oriented paving or turf area with physical site elements that encourage physical activity;
• a garden space with a diversity of vegetation types and species that provide opportunities for year-round visual interest;
• a garden space dedicated to community gardens or urban food production;
• preserved or created habitat that meets the criteria of SS Credit Site Development—Protect or Restore Habitat and also includes elements of human interaction.
For projects that achieve a density of 1.5 floor-area ratio (FAR), and are physically accessible, extensive or intensive vegetated roofs can be used toward the minimum 25% vegetation requirement, and qualifying roof-based physically accessible paving areas can be used toward credit compliance.
Wetlands or naturally designed ponds may count as open space if the side slope gradients average 1:4 (vertical : horizontal) or less and are vegetated.
For projects that are part of a multitenant complex only
Open space can be either adjacent to the building or at another location in the site master plan. The open space may be at another master plan development site as long as it is protected from development. If the open space is not adjacent to the building, provide documentation showing that the requirements have been met and the land is in a natural state or has been returned to a natural state and conserved for the life of the building.

The budget method organizes the building interior into six assemblies:
• flooring;
• ceilings;
• walls;
• thermal and acoustic insulation;
• furniture; and
• Healthcare, Schools only: exterior applied products.
Include furniture in the calculations if it is part of the scope of work. Walls, ceilings, and flooring are defined as building interior products; each layer of the assembly, including paints, coatings, adhesives, and sealants, must be evaluated for compliance. Insulation is tracked separately.
Determine the total percentage of compliant materials according to Equation 1.
Equation 1. Total percentage compliance
Total % compliant for projects without furniture =
(% compliant walls + % compliant ceilings + % compliant flooring + % compliant insulation)
4
Total % compliant for projects with furniture =
(% compliant walls + % compliant ceilings + % compliant flooring + % compliant insulation) + (% compliant furniture)
5
Equation 2. System percentage compliant
Flooring, walls, ceilings, insulation % compliant =
(compliant surface area of layer 1 + compliant surface area of layer 2 + compliant surface area of layer 3 + …)
total surface area of layer 1 + total surface area of layer 2 + total surface area of layer 3 + …)

Emissions and Content Requirements
To demonstrate compliance, a product or layer must meet all of the following requirements, as applicable.
Inherently nonemitting sources. Products that are inherently nonemitting sources of VOCs (stone, ceramic, powder-coated metals, plated or anodized metal, glass, concrete, clay brick, and unfinished or untreated solid wood) are considered fully compliant without any VOC emissions testing if they do not include integral organic-based surface coatings, binders, or sealants.
General emissions evaluation. Building products must be tested and determined compliant in accordance with California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Standard Method v1.1–2010, using the applicable exposure scenario. The default scenario is the private office scenario. The manufacturer’s or third-party certification must state the exposure scenario used to determine compliance. Claims of compliance for wet-applied products must state the amount applied in mass per surface area.
Manufacturers’ claims of compliance with the above requirements must also state the range of total VOCs after 14 days (336 hours), measured as specified in the CDPH Standard Method v1.1:
• 0.5 mg/m3 or less;
• between 0.5 and 5.0 mg/m3; or
• 5.0 mg/m3 or more.
Projects outside the U.S. may use products tested and deemed compliant in accordance with either (1) the CDPH standard method (2010) or (2) the German AgBB Testing and Evaluation Scheme (2010). Test products either with (1) the CDPH Standard Method (2010), (2) the German AgBB Testing and Evaluation Scheme (2010), (3) ISO 16000-3: 2010, ISO 16000-6: 2011, ISO 16000-9: 2006, ISO 16000-11:2006 either in conjunction with AgBB, or with French legislation on VOC emission class labeling, or (4) the DIBt testing method (2010). If the applied testing method does not specify testing details for a product group for which the CDPH standard method does provide details, use the specifications in the CDPH standard method. U.S. projects must follow the CDPH standard method.
Additional VOC content requirements for wet-applied products. In addition to meeting the general requirements for VOC emissions (above), on-site wet-applied products must not contain excessive levels of VOCs, for the health of the installers and other tradesworkers who are exposed to these products. To demonstrate compliance, a product or layer must meet the following requirements, as applicable. Disclosure of VOC content must be made by the manufacturer. Any testing must follow the test method specified in the applicable regulation.
• All paints and coatings wet-applied on site must meet the applicable VOC limits of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) 2007, Suggested Control Measure (SCM) for Architectural Coatings, or the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Rule 1113, effective June 3, 2011.
• All adhesives and sealants wet-applied on site must meet the applicable chemical content requirements of SCAQMD Rule 1168, July 1, 2005, Adhesive and Sealant Applications, as analyzed by the methods specified in Rule 1168. The provisions of SCAQMD Rule 1168 do not apply to adhesives and sealants subject to state or federal consumer product VOC regulations.
• For projects outside the U.S., all paints, coatings, adhesives, and sealants wet-applied on site must either meet the technical requirements of the above regulations, or comply with applicable national VOC control regulations, such as the European Decopaint Directive (2004/42/EC), the Canadian VOC Concentration Limits for Architectural Coatings, or the Hong Kong Air Pollution Control (VOC) Regulation.
• If the applicable regulation requires subtraction of exempt compounds, any content of intentionally added exempt compounds larger than 1% weight by mass (total exempt compounds) must be disclosed.
• If a product cannot reasonably be tested as specified above, testing of VOC content must comply with ASTM D2369-10; ISO 11890, part 1; ASTM D6886-03; or ISO 11890-2.
• For projects in North America, methylene chloride and perchloroethylene may not be intentionally added in paints, coatings, adhesives, or sealants.
Composite Wood Evaluation. Composite wood, as defined by the California Air Resources Board, Airborne Toxic Measure to Reduce Formaldehyde Emissions from Composite Wood Products Regulation, must be documented to have low formaldehyde emissions that meet the California Air Resources Board ATCM for formaldehyde requirements for ultra-low-emitting formaldehyde (ULEF) resins or no added formaldehyde resins.
Salvaged and reused architectural millwork more than one year old at the time of occupancy is considered compliant, provided it meets the requirements for any site-applied paints, coatings, adhesives, and sealants.
Furniture evaluation. New furniture and furnishing items must be tested in accordance with ANSI/BIFMA Standard Method M7.1–2011. Comply with ANSI/BIFMA e3-2011 Furniture Sustainability Standard,
Sections 7.6.1 (for half credit, by cost) OR 7.6.2 (for full credit, by cost), using either the concentration modeling approach or the emissions factor approach. Model the test results using the open plan, private office, or seating scenario in ANSI/BIFMA M7.1, as appropriate. USGBC-approved equivalent testing methodologies and contaminant thresholds are also acceptable. For classroom furniture, use the standard school classroom model in CDPH Standard Method v1.1. Documentation submitted for furniture must indicate the modeling scenario used to determine compliance.
Salvaged and reused furniture more than one year old at the time of use is considered compliant, provided it meets the requirements for any site-applied paints, coatings, adhesives, and sealants.

Do not operate permanently installed air-handling equipment during construction unless filtration media with a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) of 8, as determined by ASHRAE 52.2–2007, with errata (or equivalent filtration media class of F5 or higher, as defined by CEN Standard EN 779–2002, Particulate Air Filters for General Ventilation, Determination of the Filtration Performance), are installed at each return air grille and return or transfer duct inlet opening such that there is no bypass around the filtration media. Immediately before occupancy, replace all filtration media with the final design filtration media, installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Prohibit the use of tobacco products inside the building and within 25 feet (7.5 meters) of the building entrance during construction.

EQ-4
To establish better quality indoor air in the building after construction and during occupancy.
Select one of the following two options, to be implemented after construction ends and the building has been completely cleaned. All interior finishes, such as millwork, doors, paint, carpet, acoustic tiles, and movable furnishings (e.g., workstations, partitions), must be installed, and major VOC punch list items must be finished. The options cannot be combined.
Option 1. Flush-Out (1 point)
Path 1. Before Occupancy
Install new filtration media and perform a building flush-out by supplying a total air volume of 14,000 cubic feet of outdoor air per square foot (4 267 140 liters of outdoor air per square meter) of gross floor area while maintaining an internal temperature of at least 60°F (15°C) and no higher than 80°F (27°C) and relative humidity no higher than 60%.
OR
Path 2. During Occupancy
If occupancy is desired before the flush-out is completed, the space may be occupied only after delivery of a minimum of 3,500 cubic feet of outdoor air per square foot (1 066 260 liters of outdoor air per square meter) of gross floor area while maintaining an internal temperature of at least 60°F (15°C) and no higher than 80°F (27°C) and relative humidity no higher than 60%..
Once the space is occupied, it must be ventilated at a minimum rate of 0.30 cubic foot per minute (cfm) per square foot of outdoor air (1.5 liters per second per square meter of outside air) or the design minimum outdoor air rate determined in EQ Prerequisite Minimum Indoor Air Quality Performance, whichever is greater. During each day of the flush-out period, ventilation must begin at least three hours before occupancy and continue during occupancy. These conditions must be maintained until a total of 14,000 cubic feet per square foot of outdoor air (4 270 liters of outdoor air per square meter) has been delivered to the space.
OR
Option 2. Air Testing (2 points)
After construction ends and before occupancy, but under ventilation conditions typical for occupancy, conduct baseline IAQ testing using protocols consistent with the methods listed in Table 1 for all occupied spaces. Use current versions of ASTM standard methods, EPA compendium methods, or ISO methods, as indicated. Laboratories that conduct the tests for chemical analysis of formaldehyde and volatile
organic compounds must be accredited under ISO/IEC 17025 for the test methods they use. Retail projects may conduct the testing within 14 days of occupancy.
